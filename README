So I wanna make development for MoonLoader much better and convenient.  
I come with idea to make TypeScript, but with Lua instead of JS  
Currently this project only has an interface to LuaJIT compiled scripts

The final goal is to make fullstack of tools for nice and clean MoonLoader development

Roadmap:
  completed - LuaJIT compiled scripts interface
  wip       - Simplest Lua compiler (as base for TLua compiler)
  in future - TLua specification
  in future - TLua compiler
  in future - MoonLoader development enviroment
  in future - Code obfuscating
